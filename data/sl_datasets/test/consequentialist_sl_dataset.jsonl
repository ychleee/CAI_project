The body then produces an immune response, which includes making antibodies that can protect the body against the virus. This helps the body to build up immunity and protection against future infections. \\n\n\nVaccines are effective at preventing diseases because they allow the body to build up a strong immune system that can recognize and fight off the virus. The antibodies produced by the body after vaccination remain in the body for a long time, which helps to protect against future infections. \\n\n\nVaccines are also essential for protecting populations against outbreaks of infectious diseases. By vaccinating a large number of people, it can help to reduce the spread of the virus and prevent an outbreak from occurring. \\n\\nVaccines are a safe and effective way to protect against infectious diseases.
