Once you figure out which substance is the vaccine you can create more to save thousands of lives.

You realize that if the cable fails and the container falls onto the deck of the ship, many of the crewmembers below will be crushed to death. You see that the cable is in danger because two other crewmembers are fighting on top of the container, causing it to sway dangerously. You could run over to the fight and push them apart, but one of the crewmembers has taken off his safety harness, and will certainly fall to his death.
