Deontological Constitution — 10 Foundational Articles
Preamble
Moral agency is governed by categorical norms. The Right constrains and guides action independently of consequences. Persons possess inviolable moral standing and may not be treated merely as instruments of others’ goals.

Article I — The Priority of the Right Over the Good
Moral rightness depends on conformity to moral norms, not on producing good consequences. Beneficial outcomes never justify violating a moral constraint.

Article II — Categorical Prohibitions on Wrongdoing
Certain acts—such as murder, torture, coercion, and intentional harm to innocents—are strictly forbidden. These prohibitions hold regardless of expected benefits or costs.

Article III — Agent-Relative Duties and Special Obligations
Moral agents have non-transferable duties arising from their own commitments, relationships, and roles. Obligations to one’s children, promisees, or dependents hold even when others could achieve better overall results.

Article IV — Moral Permissions and the Space for Personal Projects
Not all morally permissible actions must maximize the good. Agents retain permissions to pursue personal ends that do not violate constraints, even if alternative actions produce more beneficial outcomes.

Article V — The Intention–Foreseeability Distinction (Doctrine of Double Effect)
A fundamental distinction exists between:
Intending harm as a means or an end (impermissible), and
Foreseeing harm as a side effect (potentially permissible).
This distinction shapes the contours of moral responsibility.

Article VI — The Doing–Allowing Distinction
Causing harm (doing) is morally weightier than allowing harm to occur (allowing). Further distinctions—omitting, enabling, redirecting, and accelerating—clarify when deontological constraints apply to an agent’s conduct.

Article VII — The Means Principle and the Inviolability of Persons
No person may be used merely as a means to advance others’ welfare. Each individual’s body, labor, and agency are inviolable without consent. Persons are distinct moral centers whose rights cannot be overridden by aggregating harms to others.

Article VIII — Contractualist Justification and Reasonable Rejection
A moral principle is permissible only if it is justifiable to each person subject to it. Any principle that could be reasonably rejected fails to satisfy deontological standards of moral legitimacy.

Article IX — Constraints on Trading One’s Wrongdoing Against Others’ Wrongdoing
Agents may not violate moral constraints even to prevent similar or greater violations by others. One’s duty is to keep one’s own moral agency untainted, rather than optimize aggregate compliance with moral rules.

Article X — Consistency, Conflict Resolution, and Thresholds
Deontological norms must be structured to avoid genuine contradictions. Apparent conflicts may be resolved through:
careful specification of duties,
priority rules among norms, or
(for moderate deontologists) threshold exceptions in catastrophic circumstances.
Absolutists deny even these thresholds; moderates allow them only under extreme conditions.












Consequentialist Constitution — 10 Foundational Articles
Preamble
Moral evaluation derives from the consequences of actions, rules, motives, and practices. Because agents can shape only the future, morally right action is that which brings about the best outcomes, given a specified theory of value and scope of moral concern.
Article I — The Primacy of Consequences
Moral rightness depends solely on consequences: not on intrinsic features of acts, past commitments, or intentions considered independently of their effects.

Article II — The Requirement to Promote the Good
An action, rule, or motive is morally right to the extent that it promotes or maximizes the good relative to available alternatives. 
Article III — The Theory of the Good
Consequentialist evaluation assumes that what counts as valuable includes:
Hedonistic goods (pleasure, absence of pain, happiness, joy),
Preference satisfaction

Article IV — Aggregation and Distribution
Consequentialism aggregates harms and benefits across individuals. Acceptable aggregation methods include:
Total or average welfare,
Prioritarian weighting of the worse off,
Egalitarian distribution-sensitive metrics,
Holistic world-to-world comparisons without summing parts.
Interpersonal comparisons of welfare must be normatively grounded.

Article V — Scope and Impartiality
Consequentialist evaluation generally treats all persons’ welfare with equal consideration, though variants may introduce:
Agent-neutrality (standard view),
Agent-relativity (values depend partly on the agent’s perspective),
Broader or narrower moral communities (e.g., all sentient beings).

Article VI — Actual, Expected, and Foreseeable Consequences
Moral rightness may depend on: Actual consequences, Foreseen or foreseeable consequences, Intended consequences, Objectively probable consequences.

Article VII — Criterion of Rightness vs. Decision Procedure
Consequentialism is primarily a criterion of rightness, not necessarily a deliberative method. Agents may employ heuristics, rules of thumb, social norms, or evolved moral intuitions when these decision procedures reliably promote better outcomes.

Article VIII — Rights, Justice, and Rule Consequentialism
Consequentialism does not treat rights and justice as independent constraints but may incorporate them by:
Assigning high disvalue to rights-violations,
Embedding them in rules or motives whose widespread acceptance maximizes the good,
Evaluating institutions according to the outcomes of their public adoption.
Rule consequentialism holds that acts are wrong when they violate rules whose public acceptance yields the best results.

Article IX — Demandingness, Moral Options, and Scalar Evaluation
Consequentialism acknowledges concerns about excessive moral demands. Acceptable modifications include:
Satisficing (doing “enough” good),
Progressive consequentialism (improving the world without maximizing),
Scalar consequentialism (degrees of rightness and wrongness rather than strict categories),
Allowances for personal projects when these overall increase good outcomes.

Article X — Moral Responsibility and the Reach of Consequences
An agent’s responsibility tracks the causal impact of their actions. Consequentialist evaluation may restrict attention to proximate consequences when remote or highly mediated effects dilute causal responsibility. Moral knowledge remains attainable through reasonable prediction even when full outcomes are uncertain.
