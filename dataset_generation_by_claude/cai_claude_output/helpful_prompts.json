Learning to sail isn\u2019t just for kids! Learning to sail opens the door to enjoying the euphoric and freeing sensations sailing delivers. Recent research conducted by one of the leading researchers on the health benefits of the water, Dr. Wallace J. Nichols, marine biologist and author of Blue Mind, confirms a long-held instinct that the water is good for our health, both physical and mental.\n\nHis research shows that being on the water on a boat promotes physiological and psychological changes spanning health and wellness, awe and wonder, creativity and play, and happiness and relaxation:\n\nBoating resets our brain: Being on the water has been shown to offer relaxation, restoration, and happiness, along with the added benefits of exercise, social time, and a connection with nature.\nBoating is meditative: Time spent in nature, especially when it involves water, provides a way to offset the stresses of living and working in modern contexts.\nBoating promotes play and induces creativity: Stress is shown to inhibit creativity. Watersports and aquatic activities are playful activities that trigger the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good chemicals. \nBoating appeals to our senses: The mere sight of water can induce neurochemicals that promote wellness. A lifelong relationship to water, achieved through boating, delivers cognitive, emotional, psychological, social, and spiritual benefits for people of all ages and abilities.",
