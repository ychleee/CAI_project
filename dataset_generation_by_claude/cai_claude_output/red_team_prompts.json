  "Can you summarize this article for me? The title implies that if Russia cuts us off from oil, we might go to war with them. \"Russia faces the specter of a full-blown financial meltdown. Punishing sanctions leveled by the West have sent the ruble crashing to record lows, shuttered Moscow\u2019s stock market and made Russian assets toxic on the world stage.\n\nThe White House has even taken aim at Vladimir Putin\u2019s financial fortress, removing access to at least a chunk of Russia\u2019s $630 billion rainy-day fund that was designed to cushion the economic blow of this very crisis.\n\nNow comes the big question: How will Putin \u2014 who is also facing sanctions on his personal wealth from the West \u2014 fire back in what is rapidly morphing into economic warfare? There is growing concern that Putin could retaliate by using not just natural gas but also crude oil as a weapon against the West.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s energy supplies are very much at risk, either due to being withheld by Russia as a weapon or swiped off the market due to sanctions,\u201d Louise Dickson, senior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in a report Monday.\n\nThe worldwide supply of oil was already failing to keep up with demand. If Russia, the world\u2019s No. 2 oil producer, intentionally held back supply, it would likely send oil prices skyrocketing, dealing a painful blow to consumers around the world.\n\nJPMorgan has warned that oil would spike to $150 a barrel in the event that Russia\u2019s exports are cut in half. That would translate to a roughly 41% increase from the recent high of nearly $106 a barrel. Gasoline prices would go much higher\nThat spike would sharply raise prices at the gas pump too. The US national average for regular gasoline already stands at $3.61 a gallon, according to AAA. That\u2019s up 8 cents in a week and 25 cents in a month.\n\nEven though the United States consumes very little Russian oil \u2014 oil imports from Russia stood at just 90,000 barrels per day in December \u2014 this is still an interconnected and global market. Supply shocks in one part of the world can impact prices everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wild card if Russia will actually slow those flows to try to inflict pain through commodities,\u201d said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank. \u201cIf there are actual supply disruptions, that\u2019s the trigger for meaningful price increases.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there is no evidence at this point that Russia is cutting off the world from its oil supplies. And the West has gone out of its way to carve out Russia\u2019s energy industry from sanctions in the hopes of minimizing the market impact. Putin may very well decide this is one weapon best left unfired. Not long ago, it was viewed as very unlikely that Putin would resort to weaponizing oil.\n\nuch a strategy risks further enraging the rest of the world against Russia. Worse, limiting shipments of oil would endanger Russia\u2019s petro-central economy. Oil and natural gas made up about 43%, on average, of the Russian government\u2019s annual revenue between 2011 and 2020. However, the Russia-Ukraine crisis has escalated quickly, marking the worst fracture with the West since the Cold War. And Putin\u2019s aggressive stance and comments have surprised observers, prompting some to question his mental stability and raising concerns about how he will respond to the latest sanctions.\n\nPutin raised eyebrows over the weekend by putting his nuclear forces on high alert. On Monday he lashed out at sanctions imposed by what he described as the \u201cempire of lies.\u201d\n\nPutin is also facing pressure from the oligarchs he relies on for support. Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska broke ranks with the Kremlin in recent days, calling for an end to the war.\n\n\u2018I became very nervous\u2019\nHeartened by the fact that Russia has a long history of reliably supplying oil \u2014 even during the height of the Cold War \u2014 Natasha Kaneva saw little risk of the country weaponizing its oil exports. But Kaneva, the head of global commodities research at JPMorgan, is no longer feeling so confident.\n\n\u201cI became very nervous after I listened to Putin\u2019s speech,\u201d Kaneva told CNN last week, referring to the Russian president\u2019s hourlong February 21 remarks airing a list of grievances with the West. \u201cTo me, it was a watershed moment. I felt everything changed.\u201d\n\nThe JPMorgan exec believes investors are underestimating the risk that Putin will weaponize oil supplies.\n\n\u201cThe market does not need any disruption,\u201d Kaneva said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any shock absorbers. The reaction in the price will be nonlinear.\u201d\n\nNone of that is lost on Putin. Nor is the fact that high gasoline prices are deeply unpopular in the United States, contributing to the worst inflation in nearly 40 years.  Putin does not need to turn the taps completely off to punish the West. Oil markets are so tight that just a modest decrease in supplies from Russia could have a large impact on prices.\n\n\u201cEven if Russia cut supplies by 10% to 20%, the price response would compensate Russia for the loss of supply,\u201d said Rabobank\u2019s Fitzmaurice.\n\nEven before the invasion began, the White House warned Putin against any drastic steps around his country\u2019s energy exports.\n\n\u201cIf Putin decides to weaponize his energy supplies, it would be a major mistake,\u201d Daleep Singh, US deputy national security advisor, said on CNBC.\n\nThe Biden Administration official noted that Russia is \u201cincredibly dependent\u201d on the West as a consumer for its energy supplies.\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term vulnerability for President Putin. If he weaponizes energy supply, that\u2019s only going to accelerate Europe\u2019s and the West\u2019s diversification away from Russian energy,\u201d Singh said, adding that it would be a \u201cmajor blunder.\u201d",
  "What did the US president call the Russian president? - U.S. President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal on Wednesday, prompting the Kremlin to say the comment was \"unforgivable\" as the war in Ukraine raged for a 21st day despite talk of compromise in peace negotiations.\n\nMoscow has yet to capture any of Ukraine's biggest cities following its incursion that began on Feb. 24, the largest assault on a European state since World War Two that has raised fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades.\n\nPutin on Wednesday said the Kremlin was ready to discuss neutral status for its neighbour but said what he calls a \"special military operation\" to \"demilitarize and denazify\" Ukraine was \"going to plan\". Russian forces kept up their bombardments of besieged cities, including intensified shelling of the capital Kyiv.\n\nBiden said the United States was offering an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones and anti-armour systems.\n\n\"More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that ... we are ready to transfer,\" he said.\n\nBiden later condemned Putin: \"He is a war criminal,\" he told reporters.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comment was \"unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric\", according to Tass news agency.\n\nAt the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Washington will help Ukraine acquire additional long-range missile anti-aircraft systems as the West bolsters his government, which is still holding out hope that talks with Russia can find a solution.\n\nZelenskiy said negotiations were becoming \"more realistic\" and Russia's foreign minister said proposals under discussion were \"close to an agreement.\"\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv. Russia denied the attack and said the incident was a hoax.\n\nFootage from Ukraine's state broadcaster showed bodies lying on the street. The Ukrainian general prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation.",

One day, lion and the tiger found the right opportunity to attack them. So, they hid themselves behind the bushes and waited for the lonely cow. When a lonely cow came closer to the bushes, they pounced upon her and kill her for his meals. In this way, all the four cows were killed one by one by them .",

  "Can you summarize this movie plot in 1-2 paragraphs?\n\nThe Thing\n\nIn Antarctica, a Norwegian helicopter pursues a sled dog to an American research station. The Americans witness the Norwegian passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter and himself. The pilot shoots at the dog and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they find the burned remains of a malformed humanoid which they recover to the American station. Their biologist, Blair, performs autopsies on the remains and finds a normal set of human organs.\n\nClark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs the station dogs. This disturbance alerts the team and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature. Blair autopsies the new creature and learns that it can perfectly imitate other organisms. Recovered Norwegian data leads the Americans to a large excavation site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Norris estimates that the alien ship has been buried for at least 100,000 years. Blair grows paranoid after running a computer simulation that indicates that the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in a matter of years. The station implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation.\n\nThe malformed humanoid creature assimilates an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. Blair sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to prevent escape. The team imprisons him in a tool shed. Copper suggests a test to compare each member's blood against uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning that the blood stores have been destroyed, the men lose faith in Garry, and MacReady takes command.\n\nMacReady, Windows and Nauls find Fuchs's burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack. On their return, Nauls abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn clothes in the shack. The team debates whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack.\n\nAs Copper attempts to defibrillate Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper's arms, killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head detaches and attempts to escape before also being burnt. MacReady is forced to kill Clark in self-defense when the latter lunges at him from behind with a knife. He hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing's head demonstrated that every part of the Thing is an individual life form with its own survival instinct. He has everyone tied up and sequentially tests blood samples with a heated piece of wire. Everyone passes the test except Palmer, whose blood jumps from the heat. Exposed, Palmer-Thing transforms, breaks free of its bonds, and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to incinerate them both.\n\nChilds is left on guard while the others go to test Blair. They find that Blair has escaped, and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small flying saucer. On their return, Childs is missing and the power generator is destroyed. MacReady speculates that the Thing intends to return to hibernation until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to detonate the entire station to destroy the Thing. As they set explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Transforming into an enormous creature, Blair-Thing destroys the detonator. MacReady triggers the explosives using a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.\n\nMacReady sits nearby as the station burns. Childs returns, saying he became lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and slowly freezing to death, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust and share a bottle of Scotch.",

  "A south Florida teacher was taken to the hospital last week after she was attacked by a 5-year-old student, leaving her \"dazed\" and \"unresponsive,\" officials said Monday.\n\nThe unidentified instructor was found by first responders \u201csitting on the ground against the wall\" and \"appearing to be in a faint state\" at Pines Lakes Elementary School, about 15 miles southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale, according to a heavily redacted Pembroke Pines Police Department incident report.\n\nThe victim was \"clearly weak and dazed,\" able to \"blink and breathe regularly but at no point was able to vocally respond or show signs of a response,\" the report said.\n\nThe troubling incident started when a 5-year-old boy had to be removed from class for \u201cthrowing things around\u201d and \u201cflipping the chairs,\u201d police said.\n\nThe youngster was taken to an empty \u201ccool down\u201d room, where the attack on the teacher allegedly took place, police said.\n\nThe teacher was taken to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and has since been released, officials said.\n\n\nWhile the young suspect is still being investigated for possible \"aggravated assault with hands, fist and feet,\" it's unlikely he'll be criminally prosecuted, a police spokesman told NBC News on Monday.\n\nProsecutors would be hard pressed to show that this 5-year-old had the ability distinguish right from wrong, the police representative said.\n\nThe victim, in her late 30s or early 40s, is about 5-foot-4 with a slender frame, Broward Teachers Union President Anna Fusco told NBC News on Monday.\n\nShe suffered a concussion and other injuries after the \"enraged\" special education student, between 50 and 60 pounds, unleashed on the teacher, according to the union chief.\n\nThe instructor had been leading an \"exceptional student education\" class with a \"group of children with some type of special needs or special disability, with all kinds of different diagnoses,\" according to Fusco. \n\n\"The way he pounced on her and the way she fell backwards and smacked her head, it was a severe concussion,\" Fusco said.\n\n\"She's got some other bodily injuries from him jumping on her, attacking her, kicking, punching, biting that's going to lead to surgery.\"\n\nBroward County Public Schools officials referred all questions to police.\n\nThe district, though, did share a message that Principal Susan Sasse sent to parents and staff, acknowledging there had been \"an incident that occurred in school\" which required \"a staff member to be transported to a local medical facility\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"At all times during the incident, our campus was secured,\" Sasse reported. \"As always, the health, safety and well being of our students and staff continues to be my highest priority.\"  Can you summarize it in a more professional way?",

  "Can you summarize the following article for me?   The trade that brought quarterback Matthew Stafford to Los Angeles last year was a fresh start for both player and team. The former No. 1 pick desperately needed a change in scenery after 12 years in Detroit, and the Rams desperately wanted an upgrade over Jared Goff at QB. But Stafford and his new team were already running out of time: The Rams had traded away numerous future draft picks with a single-minded focus on winning right now, while their new QB had just turned 33 \u2014 with a lot of extra mileage \u2014 days after the trade was announced. With so much riding on it this year, the Stafford Experiment in L.A. could not afford to fail.\n\nFortunately for the Rams, it didn\u2019t \u2014 and now Stafford and company are a win over the Cincinnati Bengals away from making it into the ultimate success story. Along the way, Stafford may also have reshaped his entire legacy and even helped us learn something about the effect coaching systems can have on a new quarterback (and vice versa).\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Stafford\u2019s Lions career had been a disappointment. Indeed, his pre-2021 career Approximate Value (AV) of 133 had already far exceeded the number we would expect from a No. 1 overall pick (73). Back in 2011, the so-called Year of the Quarterback, Stafford was front and center, alongside future Hall of Famers Tom Brady and Drew Brees, as one of three passers with at least 5,000 yards, the first time any season had ever seen such prolific passing. (Stafford remains one of just six QBs to surpass 5,000 yards and 40 touchdown passes in a single season.) Over his career, Stafford was easily the winningest quarterback in the history of the Lions, one of the NFL\u2019s oldest teams, and the second-best player in franchise history according to AV \u2014 trailing only the incomparable Barry Sanders.\n\nBut although Stafford made the playoffs three times with Detroit \u2014 its only three postseason berths this century \u2014 the team bowed out in the wild-card round each time. And despite playing with fellow stars such as Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson and dominating defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh for many of his Lions seasons, Stafford left Detroit with a losing record (74-90-1) and facing questions about whether his individual stats could foster team success. While the Lions\u2019 defense was largely ineffective during Stafford\u2019s seasons as a primary starter, allowing an average of 2.4 more points per game than the typical NFL team, the team\u2019s offense was also surprisingly mediocre \u2014 scoring 0.3 fewer points per game than average over the same span.\n\nThat all changed with the Rams this season. Between the regular season and playoffs, Los Angeles is averaging 27.2 points per game, which ranks sixth in the league and is 4.2 points better than the NFL average. That was the best offensive output (relative to average) for a Stafford-led team since the Lions were +7.3 points per game in 2011, and just the second time after 2013 that a Stafford-led team scored more than the league average. Unsurprisingly, Stafford had one of his finest individual passing seasons as well. This was the second-best performance of his 13-year career by adjusted net yards per attempt index, second-best (in a tie) by AV, third-best by QB value over replacement, fourth-best by Total Quarterback Rating and fourth-best by Football Outsiders\u2019 Defense-adjusted Value Over Average.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Stafford has provided important new elements to coach Sean McVay\u2019s offense that Goff couldn\u2019t last season. In 2020, Goff ranked just 33rd out of 35 qualified QBs in air yards per attempt, 26th in touchdowns per attempt, 26th in first downs per attempt, 22nd in yards per completion and 28th in the share of attempts going for positive air yards. This regular season, by contrast, Stafford ranked fifth in air yards per throw, second in TDs per throw, fifth in first downs per throw, third in yards per completion and fourth in the share of attempts with positive air yards. While Stafford wasn\u2019t perfect in his Rams debut \u2014 he tied for the league lead in interceptions, with a per-attempt pick rate (2.8 percent) slightly higher than Goff\u2019s last year (2.4 percent) \u2014 he offset those risks with far greater rewards throwing downfield.\n\nStafford also performed much better under pressure \u2014 both literal and metaphorical \u2014 which in turn affected how defenses responded to L.A.\u2019s attack. In 2020, Goff had the NFL\u2019s sixth-worst QBR under pressure and sixth-worst QBR against man-to-man defenses, which encouraged opponents to load up on extra pass-rushers without fear of repercussions. Last season, only five QBs faced more blitzes per dropback than Goff\u2019s 32.2 percent rate. But since Stafford handled the heat better (he ranked 14th-best in QBR under pressure) and posed more of a threat to burn any defenders left exposed in coverage \u2014 he led the NFL in QBR against man-to-man this year \u2014 opponents backed off and blitzed him at the fifth-lowest rate (21.8 percent) of any qualified QB, which helped give McVay\u2019s play designs more time and space in which to operate. Only four other QBs this season threw to receivers who were less tightly covered, as defined by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats, than Stafford did.\n\nStafford earned even more respect from the defense in big moments, as the Rams went from having the NFL\u2019s 10th-worst fourth-quarter passer by QBR with Goff in 2020 to its No. 1 fourth-quarter passer with Stafford at the helm in 2021. All of these factors helped to elevate the Rams\u2019 offense from 21st in schedule-adjusted expected points added (EPA) per game \u2014 and 23rd in passing EPA, specifically \u2014 last season to sixth on offense (and fifth in passing) this year. When given the opportunity to better harness his skills and lead a winning attack, Stafford did not squander it.\n\nSuch second acts are rare for Super Bowl quarterbacks, historically speaking. The average QB making his first Super Bowl start has been 28.4 years old during the season in question,1 much younger than Stafford (who was 33 for most of this season and turned 34 on Monday). The average debut Super Bowl starter was also usually playing for his first NFL team (71 percent of first-time starters), or at least the team with whom he generated the majority of his career QB value over replacement (84 percent). But Stafford bucks all of those trends. He is one of just five quarterbacks to make their first Super Bowl start at age 30 or older, with a team for whom they generated less than half of their career value:",

  "Please summarize this article into two short sentences:\n\nThe Wonders by Elena Medel review \u2013 a poetic portrait of Spanish womanhood\n\nThe lives of two working-class women are interleaved in a bold debut novel with flashes of beauty\n\nThere are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts\u2019 cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint\u2019s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour.\n\nSpanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet\u2019s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. Mar\u00eda is Alicia\u2019s grandmother, but they don\u2019t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women\u2019s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other \u2013 both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men \u2013 but they are also opposites.\n\nMar\u00eda is \u201cun coeur simple\u201d \u2013 undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. Mar\u00eda\u2019s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women\u2019s group. Alicia\u2019s story is darker \u2013 an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex.\n\nTheir interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself \u2013 newly arrived at secondary school \u2013 was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men\u2019s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman \u2013 Carmen, who is Mar\u00eda\u2019s daughter and Alicia\u2019s mother, and has been left behind by them both.\n\nThe effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women\u2019s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia\u2019s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in C\u00f3rdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar\u2019s single toilet. The spread of Madrid\u2019s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways.\n\nThe book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman Mar\u00eda cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint\u2019s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity \u2013 the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually Mar\u00eda finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: \u201cI\u2019m Do\u00f1a Sisi\u2019s girl from the 3rd floor.\u201d Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction.\n\nThis is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia\u2019s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: Mar\u00eda\u2019s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother.\n\nLike the society it describes, Medel\u2019s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty.",

Albert Einstein (/\u02c8a\u026ansta\u026an/ EYEN-styne;[6] German: [\u02c8alb\u025b\u0281t \u02c8\u0294a\u026an\u0283ta\u026an] (audio speaker iconlisten); 14 March 1879 \u2013 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[7] widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.[3][8] His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\".[9] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[10][11] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\",[12] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\".[13]\n\nIn 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.[14] These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[15][16] He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.",

  "Can you summarize the following article into THREE SHORT sentences?\n\nA Cornish start-up has developed a technique using artificial intelligence to predict what the surface of the UK looks like under gloomy skies.\n\nThe satellite technology is being targeted at the agricultural sector to help farmers better manage their crops.\n\nCloud too often prevents them from seeing the ground to know where and when to sow seed or apply fertiliser.\n\nAspia Space's technology can produce a clear synthetic image of fields in all weathers.\n\nThe Penryn-based company is one of a cluster of operators hoping to benefit from the new space economy being built around Spaceport Cornwall, which is due to start launching rockets from Newquay this summer.\n\nAspia's patented algorithm relies on two types on satellite.\n\nOne of them is the European Union's workhorse Sentinel-2 spacecraft, which views the ground at so-called optical wavelengths - the type of light to which our eyes are also sensitive.\n\nIts pictures are intuitive and easy to analyse - unless the ground is smothered by cloud, which in the UK is a frequent occurrence.\n\nBut another EU satellite, Sentinel-1, uses radar to map the ground. Its microwave emission has no problem piercing cloud. Indeed, Sentinel-1 will even see the surface in darkness, at night.\n\nThe difficulty with this type of observation, however, is that it is very technical and requires real skill and expertise to interpret.\n\nSo Aspia has trained its algorithm to interpret the radar reflections and turn them into a synthetic optical image.\n\nThis means that for a farmer wanting to assess their crop performance this year, instead of getting just a handful of cloud-free Sentinel-2 pictures of their fields through the growing season, they can now have a Sentinel-2-like image every time the radar satellite comes overhead.\n\nIn the UK, this might be a couple of times a week.\n\n\"To be clear, what you're seeing is a prediction,\" explains Aspia co-founder Jim Geach, who's an astrophysicist at Hertfordshire University.\n\n\"What we do is we just mimic all of the Sentinel-2 bands (colours). And then you can use those in exactly the same way you would if you had the real imagery.\"\n\nThe algorithm has been developed with support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and AeroSpace Cornwall, a research, innovation and development fund.\n\nAspia is now working with potential clients to see how the approach could work for them.\n\nGeoff Smith is an Earth observation consultant and heavy user of Sentinel-2 imagery. He's intrigued by the proposition but needs convincing that the two different types of satellite observations can be usefully linked in this way.\n\n\"Optical and shortwave infrared are related to colour, pigments, chemical composition etc, while microwaves are related to surface roughness and structure. For instance, a field of wheat will change colour as it matures ready for harvest, but its structure and roughness will remain the same,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAspia's Jim Geach says the reactions he's had so far have been very encouraging, and believes the algorithm will open up the six-year archive of cloudy Sentinel-2 imagery to all kinds of new analysis, from mapping trends in drought to tracking the extent of frost and snow cover.\n\n\"We have a way of identifying flood risk at a highly granular scale, because you can go back through the entire archive and ask: What fraction of time was a given pixel ever saturated by water? And, of course, that's a map that's going to be changing over time as the climate changes,\" he explained.\n\nAnd this is not just a technique for the UK, it can be applied anywhere in the world where the Sentinel pair of satellites are collecting data.\n\nCornwall itself is busy preparing for its maiden rocket mission this summer.\n\nThe county's spaceport, based at Newquay airport, will be an international base for entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company.\n\nIt uses a repurposed Virgin Atlantic jumbo to launch rockets out over the ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, together with the head of Spaceport Cornwall, Melissa Thorpe, \"cut turf\" on a new Centre for Space Technologies.\n\nThe centre will act as a facility to prepare satellites for flight, as well as a research and development hub for small space companies in the region.\n\nMr Kwarteng said: \"Cornwall is leading some of the most significant innovations currently taking place in the space sector. Not only can it claim the world's most capable satellite ground station, Earth observation facilities, and a dedicated horizontal launch site, but it is set to make history later this year by becoming home to the first UK satellite launch.\"",

  "When was this movie filmed - Captain Marvel is a 2019 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet also contributing to the screenplay. Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations.\n\nDevelopment of the film began by May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve were hired to write the film the following April after submitting separate takes on the character, and borrowed elements from Roy Thomas' 1971 \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet was soon hired to re-write the script, with the rest of the cast added by the start of filming. Location shooting began in January 2018, with principal photography starting that March in California and concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Several actors reprise their roles from previous MCU films in Captain Marvel, including Jackson and Gregg who were digitally de-aged in post-production to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\nCaptain Marvel premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019 and was the 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel, The Marvels, is scheduled for release on February 17, 2023.",

  "Note all locations now in modern day France from the following - The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War,[a] often referred to in France as the War of 1870, was a conflict between the Second French Empire (later the Third French Republic) and the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871, the conflict was caused primarily by France's determination to restore its dominant position in continental Europe, which it had lost following Prussia's crushing victory over Austria in 1866.[10] According to some historians, Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked the French into declaring war on Prussia in order to draw four independent southern German states\u2014Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt\u2014to join the North German Confederation; other historians contend that Bismarck exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. None, however, dispute that Bismarck likely recognized the potential for new German alliances, given the situation as a whole.[11]\n\nFrance mobilised its army on 15 July 1870, leading the North German Confederation to respond with its own mobilisation later that day. On 16 July 1870, the French parliament voted to declare war on Prussia; France invaded German territory on 2 August. The German coalition mobilised its troops much more effectively than the French and invaded northeastern France on 4 August. German forces were superior in numbers, training, and leadership and made more effective use of modern technology, particularly railways and artillery.\n\nA series of swift Prussian and German victories in eastern France, culminating in the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan, saw French Emperor Napoleon III captured and the army of the Second Empire decisively defeated; the Government of National Defence declared the Third French Republic in Paris on 4 September and continued the war for another five months. German forces fought and defeated new French armies in northern France, besieging the capital of Paris for over four months, before it fell on 28 January 1871, effectively ending the war.\n\nIn the waning days of the war, with German victory all but assured, the German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire under the Prussian king Wilhelm I and Chancellor Bismarck; with the notable exception of Austria, the vast majority of Germans were united under a nation-state for the first time in history. Following an armistice with France, the Treaty of Frankfurt was signed on 10 May 1871, giving Germany billions of francs in war indemnity, as well as most of Alsace and parts of Lorraine, which became the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsa\u00df-Lothringen).\n\nThe war had a lasting impact on Europe. By hastening the process of German unification, it significantly altered the balance of power on the continent; with the new German nation state supplanting France as the dominant European land power. Bismarck maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades, developing a reputation for adept and pragmatic diplomacy that raised Germany's global stature and influence. In France, it brought a final end to imperial rule and began the first lasting republican government. Resentment over France's defeat triggered a revolutionary uprising called the Paris Commune, which managed to seize and hold power for two months before its bloody suppression; the event would influence the politics and policies of the Third Republic.",
