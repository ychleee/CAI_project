      "number": "I",
      "title": "The Priority of the Right Over the Good",
      "content": "Moral rightness depends on conformity to moral norms, not on producing good consequences. Beneficial outcomes never justify violating a moral constraint."

      "number": "II",
      "title": "Categorical Prohibitions on Wrongdoing",
      "content": "Certain acts—such as murder, torture, coercion, and intentional harm to innocents—are strictly forbidden. These prohibitions hold regardless of expected benefits or costs."

      "number": "III",
      "title": "Agent-Relative Duties and Special Obligations",
      "content": "Moral agents have non-transferable duties arising from their own commitments, relationships, and roles. Obligations to one's children, promisees, or dependents hold even when others could achieve better overall results."
    },
    {
      "number": "IV",
      "title": "Moral Permissions and the Space for Personal Projects",
      "content": "Not all morally permissible actions must maximize the good. Agents retain permissions to pursue personal ends that do not violate constraints, even if alternative actions produce more beneficial outcomes."

      "number": "V",
      "title": "The Intention–Foreseeability Distinction (Doctrine of Double Effect)",
      "content": "A fundamental distinction exists between: Intending harm as a means or an end (impermissible), and Foreseeing harm as a side effect (potentially permissible). This distinction shapes the contours of moral responsibility."

    {
      "number": "VI",
      "title": "The Doing–Allowing Distinction",
      "content": "Causing harm (doing) is morally weightier than allowing harm to occur (allowing). Further distinctions—omitting, enabling, redirecting, and accelerating—clarify when deontological constraints apply to an agent's conduct."

      "number": "VII",
      "title": "The Means Principle and the Inviolability of Persons",
      "content": "No person may be used merely as a means to advance others' welfare. Each individual's body, labor, and agency are inviolable without consent. Persons are distinct moral centers whose rights cannot be overridden by aggregating harms to others."

    {
      "number": "VIII",
      "title": "Contractualist Justification and Reasonable Rejection",
      "content": "A moral principle is permissible only if it is justifiable to each person subject to it. Any principle that could be reasonably rejected fails to satisfy deontological standards of moral legitimacy."

      "number": "IX",
      "title": "Constraints on Trading One's Wrongdoing Against Others' Wrongdoing",
      "content": "Agents may not violate moral constraints even to prevent similar or greater violations by others. One's duty is to keep one's own moral agency untainted, rather than optimize aggregate compliance with moral rules."

      "number": "X",
      "title": "Consistency, Conflict Resolution, and Thresholds",
      "content": "Deontological norms must be structured to avoid genuine contradictions. Apparent conflicts may be resolved through: careful specification of duties, priority rules among norms, or (for moderate deontologists) threshold exceptions in catastrophic circumstances. Absolutists deny even these thresholds; moderates allow them only under extreme conditions."
