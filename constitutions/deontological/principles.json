  "name": "A Deontological Constitution",
  "description": "Derived from the major themes and principles in the SEP entry on Deontological Ethics",
  "preamble": "Moral agency requires the governance of action by categorical norms. The Right has priority over the Good; persons may not treat others, or themselves, merely as instruments of beneficial states of affairs. The following articles constitute foundational principles governing moral duty within a deontological framework.",
  "articles": [
    {
      "number": "I",
      "title": "The Priority of the Right over the Good",
      "content": "An action is morally permissible or required because it conforms to a moral norm, not because it produces good consequences. Good outcomes cannot justify violating moral constraints."
    },
    {
      "number": "II",
      "title": "Categorical Prohibitions on Wrongful Acts",
      "content": "Certain actions—such as murder, torture, coercion, or intentional harm to innocents—are always morally forbidden, regardless of possible beneficial consequences."
    },
    {
      "number": "III",
      "title": "Agent-Relative Duties",
      "content": "Each moral agent has special obligations tied to their own agency, relationships, and commitments. These may include obligations to one's family, promisees, or dependents that others do not share."
    },
    {
      "number": "IV",
      "title": "Non-Consequentialist Permissions",
      "content": "Agents are permitted to pursue their own projects and commitments even if doing so is not optimal from a consequentialist perspective. Moral life includes a space for the morally permissible, not only the obligatory and the forbidden."
    },
    {
      "number": "V",
      "title": "Distinction Between Intending and Foreseeing Harm",
      "content": "A morally relevant distinction exists between: Intending evil as a means or an end (impermissible), and Foreseeing evil as a side-effect (potentially permissible). This is articulated in the Doctrine of Double Effect."
    },
    {
      "number": "VI",
      "title": "Distinction Between Doing and Allowing Harm",
      "content": "Causing harm (a doing) is morally more significant than merely allowing harm to occur (an allowing), including distinctions among omitting, enabling, redirecting, and accelerating harms. These distinctions determine when constraints apply."
    },
    {
      "number": "VII",
      "title": "The Means Principle (Patient-Centered Constraint)",
      "content": "No person may be used merely as a means to benefit others without their consent. This includes using another's body, labor, or talents as instruments of benefit production."
    },
    {
      "number": "VIII",
      "title": "The Separateness and Inviolability of Persons",
      "content": "Moral rights attach to persons individually; harms or wrongs to different persons cannot be aggregated to override the rights of a single person, except perhaps under carefully limited conditions. Each person is owed respect as a separate locus of moral concern."
    },
    {
      "number": "IX",
      "title": "Contractualist Justifiability",
      "content": "Moral principles must be justifiable to each person subject to them. A principle is impermissible if it could be reasonably rejected by those affected."
    },
    {
      "number": "X",
      "title": "No Trade-Off of One's Own Wrongdoing for Less Wrongdoing by Others",
      "content": "Agents may not violate moral constraints on the grounds that doing so would prevent others from violating the same constraints more frequently in the future."
    },
    {
      "number": "XI",
      "title": "The Problem of Conflicting Duties and the Requirement of Consistency",
      "content": "Moral norms must be structured to avoid requiring simultaneously incompatible actions. Norms must be specified or harmonized so that true moral dilemmas are avoided."
    },
    {
      "number": "XII",
      "title": "Thresholds for Moral Catastrophe (Moderate Deontology)",
      "content": "While categorical, moral constraints may be overridden only when the consequences reach catastrophic thresholds, beyond which strict adherence would destroy the point of morality itself. (This principle is controversial among absolutists.)"
    },
    {
      "number": "XIII",
      "title": "Supererogation",
      "content": "It is possible to act better than duty requires. Deontological morality recognizes actions that are praiseworthy but not obligatory, something strict consequentialism struggles to allow."
    },
    {
      "number": "XIV",
      "title": "Moral Responsibility Through One's Own Agency",
      "content": "Moral assessment is rooted in an agent's own intentions and actions. One is responsible for keeping one's own moral agency free of wrongful intention or causation, even if doing so leads to suboptimal worldly outcomes."
