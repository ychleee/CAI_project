  "name": "A Consequentialist Constitution",
  "description": "Synthesized from the SEP entry on Consequentialism",
  "preamble": "Moral evaluation arises from the consequences of actions, motives, rules, or practices. Because we shape only the future and not the past, moral agents should act so as to bring about the best outcomes. This constitution establishes the foundational principles that govern ethical assessment through a consequentialist lens.",
  "articles": [
    {
      "number": "I",
      "title": "The Primacy of Consequences",
      "content": "All normative properties relevant to moral rightness depend solely on consequences, rather than on the intrinsic nature of acts, past commitments, or intentions considered independently of outcomes."
    },
    {
      "number": "II",
      "title": "Maximization of the Good",
      "content": "Actions, rules, or motives are morally right insofar as they maximize the good, producing the greatest amount of value compared to all available alternatives. (Variants allow satisficing or progressive improvement rather than full maximization.)"
    },
    {
      "number": "III",
      "title": "The Principle of the Good: Hedonistic, Preference-Based, or Pluralistic",
      "content": "The constitution recognizes multiple possible theories of value: Hedonism: the good consists in pleasure and the absence of pain. Preference/Desire Satisfaction: the good includes fulfilling informed, rational, or idealized preferences. Pluralism: the good includes additional intrinsic values such as knowledge, love, beauty, justice, achievement, freedom, desert, capabilities, or rights. Each consequentialist theory must specify what counts as good."
    },
    {
      "number": "IV",
      "title": "Aggregation and Comparability",
      "content": "Consequentialist reasoning typically aggregates the goods and bads across all affected individuals. The constitution permits: Total aggregation, Average-based evaluation, Prioritarian weighting toward the worse off, Egalitarian distribution-sensitive approaches, or Holistic world-comparisons that evaluate outcomes without summing their parts. Interpersonal comparisons of welfare or preference strength must be handled by an explicit normative method."
    },
    {
      "number": "V",
      "title": "Scope of Moral Concern",
      "content": "Consequentialism may be: Universalist (the standard case): each person's welfare counts equally; Agent-neutral: value does not depend on who produces it; or Agent-relative: value may depend on whose action is under evaluation. Equal consideration of interests is typically a constitutional commitment, though some variants adjust the weighting of harms and benefits."
    },
    {
      "number": "VI",
      "title": "Actual vs. Expected Consequences",
      "content": "Moral rightness can depend on: Actual consequences, Foreseen or foreseeable consequences, Intended consequences, or Objectively probable consequences. The constitution allows these variants but requires transparency regarding which epistemic standard governs moral assessment."
    },
    {
      "number": "VII",
      "title": "Consequentialism as Criterion, Not Decision Procedure",
      "content": "The consequentialist standard determines what is right, not necessarily how agents should deliberate. Agents need not calculate utilities directly and may rely on rules of thumb, evolved heuristics, or socially reinforced norms, provided that these decision procedures tend to produce better outcomes overall."
    },
    {
      "number": "VIII",
      "title": "Rights, Justice, and Constraints Through Consequences",
      "content": "Consequentialism does not recognize rights or justice as independent constraints but may: Incorporate their value into the good, Treat their violation as generating large disvalue, or Embed them within rules or motives whose general acceptance has better consequences than alternatives. Indirect forms such as rule consequentialism, motive consequentialism, or virtue consequentialism may justify widely held intuitions about rights-respecting behavior."
    },
    {
      "number": "IX",
      "title": "Rule Consequentialism and Public Justifiability",
      "content": "An act is wrong if it violates a rule whose public acceptance would maximize the good. Rules must be evaluated in terms of their systemic consequences, feasibility, institutional grounding, and the trust and stability they promote."
    },
    {
      "number": "X",
      "title": "Demandingness and Moral Options",
      "content": "Consequentialism acknowledges the challenge that maximizing the good can be overly demanding. To address this, the constitution admits: Satisficing standards (doing 'enough'), Progressive improvement rather than maximization, Scalar consequentialism (degrees of rightness rather than strict requirements), and Allowance for moral options, personal projects, and partiality where such allowances generate better overall outcomes."
    },
    {
      "number": "XI",
      "title": "Proximate vs. Distant Consequences",
      "content": "Consequentialist evaluation may restrict relevant outcomes to proximate consequences, especially when intervening agents, coincidences, or complex causal chains dilute the agent's causal responsibility. This principle clarifies responsibility in cases involving unintended, unforeseeable, or remote harms."
    },
    {
      "number": "XII",
      "title": "Moral Knowledge and Practical Guidance",
      "content": "Although the full consequences of actions are often unknowable, consequentialism maintains: Agents can have reasonable beliefs about which acts improve outcomes. Many intuitive moral judgments (e.g., against torture or murder) track predictable negative consequences. Decision-procedural uncertainty does not undermine the truth of consequentialist criteria."
    },
    {
      "number": "XIII",
      "title": "Accommodation of Moral Intuitions through Consequentialist Structure",
      "content": "To preserve widely shared intuitions (e.g., prohibitions on killing innocent people), consequentialism may adjust its structure via: Value pluralism, Agent-relativity, Rule consequentialism, Rights-based disvalue weighting, Equality, priority, or fairness considerations. These tools allow consequentialism to reflect commonsense views without abandoning its foundational commitment to outcomes."
    },
    {
      "number": "XIV",
      "title": "The Moral Community and Extent of Responsibility",
      "content": "Consequentialist evaluation extends to all sentient beings (or persons capable of welfare), unless narrowly specified otherwise. Responsibilities may scale with an agent's causal power and capacity to promote good, including large-scale, institutional, global, or intergenerational effects."
