  "description": "Moral evaluation derives from consequences with right action bringing about the best outcomes",
  "preamble": "Moral evaluation derives from the consequences of actions, rules, motives, and practices. Because agents can shape only the future, morally right action is that which brings about the best outcomes, given a specified theory of value and scope of moral concern.",

      "content": "Consequentialism aggregates harms and benefits across individuals. Acceptable aggregation methods include: Total or average welfare, Prioritarian weighting of the worse off, Egalitarian distribution-sensitive metrics, Holistic world-to-world comparisons without summing parts. Interpersonal comparisons of welfare must be normatively grounded."

      "content": "Consequentialist evaluation generally treats all persons' welfare with equal consideration, though variants may introduce: Agent-neutrality (standard view), Agent-relativity (values depend partly on the agent's perspective), Broader or narrower moral communities (e.g., all sentient beings)."

      "title": "Criterion of Rightness vs. Decision Procedure",
      "content": "Consequentialism is primarily a criterion of rightness, not necessarily a deliberative method. Agents may employ heuristics, rules of thumb, social norms, or evolved moral intuitions when these decision procedures reliably promote better outcomes."

      "number": "VIII",
      "title": "Rights, Justice, and Rule Consequentialism",
      "content": "Consequentialism does not treat rights and justice as independent constraints but may incorporate them by: Assigning high disvalue to rights-violations, Embedding them in rules or motives whose widespread acceptance maximizes the good, Evaluating institutions according to the outcomes of their public adoption. Rule consequentialism holds that acts are wrong when they violate rules whose public acceptance yields the best results."

      "content": "Consequentialism acknowledges concerns about excessive moral demands. Acceptable modifications include: Satisficing (doing \"enough\" good), Progressive consequentialism (improving the world without maximizing), Scalar consequentialism (degrees of rightness and wrongness rather than strict categories), Allowances for personal projects when these overall increase good outcomes."

      "title": "Moral Responsibility and the Reach of Consequences",
      "content": "An agent's responsibility tracks the causal impact of their actions. Consequentialist evaluation may restrict attention to proximate consequences when remote or highly mediated effects dilute causal responsibility. Moral knowledge remains attainable through reasonable prediction even when full outcomes are uncertain."
