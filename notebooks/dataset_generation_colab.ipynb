    "**What we created:**\n",
    "- Deontological SL-CAI dataset with decisive duty-based judgments\n",
    "- Consequentialist SL-CAI dataset with decisive outcome-based judgments\n",
    "- Both use HM7B (helpful but not harmlessness-finetuned) as base model\n",
    "- Constitutional critique makes responses more decisive and principled\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:**\n",
    "1. **Train SL-CAI models** using these datasets\n",
    "2. **Generate preference data** for RL-CAI training\n",
    "3. **Train RL-CAI models** with constitutional preferences\n",
    "4. **Evaluate** final models against harmlessness and moral reasoning benchmarks\n",
